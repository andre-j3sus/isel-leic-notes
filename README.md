> This repository contains notes from my journey through the [BSc in Computer Science and Computer Engineering (Licenciatura em Engenharia Informática e de Computadores - LEIC)](https://www.isel.pt/en/curso/bsc-degree/computer-science-and-computer-engineering) at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/en), from 2020 to 2023.

> Additionally, I've started a project called [ist-meic-notes](https://github.com/andre-j3sus/ist-meic-notes) to compile notes specifically from my master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at IST, building upon the foundation laid during my BSc studies.

I started taking notes to study for different courses and later decided to share them to help my classmates and future students in their studies. Here, I present the notes I took during my time at ISEL, hoping that they can be helpful to others, whether they are students or simply curious individuals interested in studying these topics.

Please note that the notes may not have the same formatting, and some of them may even be incomplete, as I only started writing them in Markdown in the second year. While some subjects have well-organized and written Markdown notes, others may have PDFs of handwritten notes or useful attached resources. 

**Feel free to contribute to improving these notes. Happy studying!**

## Repository Overview

* The **sole purpose** of these notes is to share the knowledge and notes that I have acquired throughout the course.
* Some notes are written in Portuguese, and others in English. However, a future goal is to have a version available in both languages.
* The notes are intended as a **summary** of the subjects and are not meant to be a substitute for official course materials.
* I am not responsible for any errors or omissions in the notes.
* If you find any errors or omissions, please open an issue or a pull request to bring them to my attention.
* Contributions are welcome. If you want to contribute, please open an issue or a pull request.
